<h1>Levels I coded:</h1>

<h2>Level 1:</h2>
<h3>Checkbox</h3>
I didn't code this, 'cuz it's too simple. I don't need to spend more time adding a checkbox clicker.<br>

<h2><b>Level 2:</b></h2>
<h3>Stop Signs</h3>
To save time, it just automatically clicks all four correct squares, then almost immediately verifies. If you refresh problem though, and change it to different stop sign, this won't help. Only did first one.<br>

<h2>Level 3:</h2>
<h3>Wiggles</h3>
Couldn't find a way to code this.<br>

<h2><b>Level 4:</b></h2>
<h3>Vegetables</h3>
Just like for stop sign, it automatically selects correct squares and verifies.<br>

<h2><b>Level 8:</b></h2>
<h3>License Plate</h3>
